Hopefully this will be useful to someone...

Vision
The idea for this study circle was to allow people to try a lot of different games, preferably "classics" and things they had never seen before. An extended goal was to improve the game design literacy in Gothenburg. An important part of succeeding with this mission was to allow people with jobs and other important duties to participate, hopefully letting them use their improved knowledge in their day-to-day work. This meant that no preparation would be required before each meeting, like reading texts or playing games outside the circle hours.

Preparations
Before letting people sign up for the circle I (Erik Sved√§ng) did a quick survey on Facebook, asking people if they'd be interested in a game design circle. The response was positive with around 30 people saying that they would be up for it. When opening the actual sign-up I got 13 quick responses and all of these people were admitted to the circle. A few late sign-ups were rejected since I didn't want the room we were using to become too crowded (this was a good call).

Diversity
All the people participating in the circle were white and male, most of them in their twenties. Maybe half were university students. The lack of diversity is a shame, especially since this was a very approachable (and fun!) study circle to be a part of. Just show up and play some games - this surely should appeal to a lot of different people..?! The main issue here is that I didn't market the circle to the general public, instead focusing on getting people who were already doing game design to participate. Combined with the general lack of diversity in the game development scene here in Gothenburg the result is not surprising. Maybe next time trying to reach more people outside the tightly knit "games scene" would be the way to go, trying to make people with other jobs and backgrounds to realize the value of knowing some game design? Also, the participants this first semester can hopefully be "ambassadeurs" for the whole concept.

Making people show up
We had a small fee for participating which was used to buy some coffee and cookies for each meetup. The main purpose of the fee was to make people feel more invested in the circle and increase the likelihood of everyone showing up each time. This worked out fairly well and we rarely dropped below 10 people on any evening. We noticed that it's a very good idea to have games that allow for an odd number of players. Several times all of the games selected were for two people only and someone had to sit out a match. Also, it goes without saying that coffee is a very important ingredient when trying to play mentally intensive games on a weekday evening.

Location
The Game Incubator here in Gothenburg (were several of us rent a shared "indie office") lended their two conference rooms to us, which was extremely nice of them! These worked out great, especially since people could also spread out in the corridor and kitchen area. When playing and learning games, people tend to become quite loud and it's very beneficial to not have to be all in the same room, blabbering over each other.

Time
The circle were held on eight succesive Monday evenings, from 18:30 to 21:00. Each meeting followed the same structure: The first 15 minutes were used to present the games, when and how they were created, and give a very high level overview of their rules. Then we split up into groups playing the games for around 90 minutes. The last 45 minutes were used for discussing our experiences, going through one game at a time. This format worked fairly well, although it was often hard to get to play more than two or three games each time (making it harder for people to participate fully in each discussion). Just selecting one or two games that everyone plays would definitely be an alternative way to do it.

Season 2?
I still haven't decided if I'll arrange a new circle in the spring. It takes a lot of time and energy but I also feel like we all learned a lot, so hopefully it can be done.
